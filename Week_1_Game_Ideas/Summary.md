# Game 1: Balatro
## Game Type: Roguelike Card Game
## Game Prototype: Balatro
## **Game Description**
A roguelike game based on playing cards.

Main mechanics:

- Players play different card combinations based on poker hands (pair, high card, flush, straight, etc.) to earn points; when points reach the required amount, the stage is cleared.
- Three rounds make up a major stage. At the end of a major stage there is an extra reward.
- At the end of each round, use the round reward coins to buy buffs (i.e., jester cards). For example: increase the points earned by a specific hand type, or increase points when even-numbered cards a[...]
  
## **Additional Ideas**
- Re-skin the game and reduce the number of cards by replacing the standard deck with tarot cards.
- Use the Minor Arcana for regular hands; replace the four suits with four elements: Wands, Cups, Coins (Pentacles), and Swords.
  - Element effects: when Cups and Coins both form a pair, points are doubled; when Wands and Cups are both played together, points are halved.
- Use Major Arcana cards (e.g., The Fool, The Tower, Judgment) to replace the in-game jester-card buffs. Example: The Tower card’s effect — after playing two Water cards, the next Earth card playe[...]
- Reduce the number of rounds per run to 3–6.

## Game Description:
- Craft & Life is an open-world sandbox life simulation game that blends the creative freedom of voxel-based building with the warmth and structure of a farming and social simulation.

- Players begin a new life in this game, a procedurally generated 3D world where every block can be shaped and transformed. Players are free to build their own home, cultivate farmland, explore caves,[...]

- The game encourages players to balance creativity, productivity, and relationships. Seasonal changes affect crops, events, and NPC behavior, while progression systems unlock new tools, buildings and[...]

**Added Ideas:**
- World Memory System
The game world remembers significant player actions over time. Locations gain historical meaning, environments change permanently, and NPCs react to past events, creating a persistent and evolving wor[...]

- Behavior-Based Player Identity
Instead of choosing a predefined role or class, the player’s identity is formed dynamically through gameplay behavior. NPC attitudes, dialogue, and story outcomes adapt based on how the player lives[...]

## Possible Challenges:
- Accidentally causing damage to the environment may affect subsequent development, and an archive function can be established to address this issue.

- A behavior-based identity system may lead to unexpected interpretations of player intent, potentially reducing players’ sense of control over their in-game identity.

- Persistent world memory and evolving environments increase technical complexity and may impact performance, especially in large, heavily modified worlds.

# Game 4: Flappy Bird
## Game Type: Arcade
## Game Prototype: Flappy Bird
## Game Description:
Players control a bird that moves vertically along the screen's axis, navigating through gaps between trees that scroll horizontally.

# Game 5: Park Street Survivor
## Game Type: Vertical Scrolling Arcade, Survival Resource Management
## Game Prototype: 
- Road Fighter: Vertical scrolling and obstacle avoidance
- Crossy Road: Grid-based movement and voxel/pixel aesthetic
## Game Description:
- A satirical survival game simulating the daily struggle of a UoB student trying to reach the Merchant Venturers Building before a 9 AM lecture.(Could be any building ->Multiple maps)

- The game features an infinitely scrolling map of Park Street (a steep hill). The player must navigate through traffic and pedestrians while managing three dynamic stats: Stamina, Mood, and Time.

- The Goal: Survive the climb and reach the top before running out of stats.

- The Struggle: The screen constantly scrolls downwards. If the player is too slow (stopped by obstacles or interactions) and falls off the bottom of the screen, they are "Late" (Game Over).

- The Obstacles: Players must dodge speeding First Buses, erratic Voi Scooters, and slow-walking tourists.

- The Choices: Players encounter random events like a homeless person asking for change or a Tesco offering a Meal Deal. They must decide: risk stopping to interact (restoring Mood/Stamina but losing [...]

## **Added Ideas:**
1. Risk-Reward Interaction Mechanic
- Unlike standard arcade games, interacting with shops (Tesco) or NPCs requires the player to stand still in a specific zone for 2 seconds while the screen continues to scroll.
2. Dynamic Weather Physics
- The game implements a variable physics engine. When the weather changes to "Bristol Rain", the friction coefficient decreases, causing the player character to slide (inertia) after moving. In "Heavy[...]
3. The "Bristol Item" System

- Players can pick up items that change gameplay mechanics using the Strategy Pattern:

  - Voi Scooter: Increases speed by 200% but disables braking (high risk).

  - Broken Umbrella: Provides immunity to "Rain" physics but breaks after 3 hits.

  - Noise-Cancelling Headphones: Automatically ignores negative social events (Promoters/Homeless) but blocks positive audio cues (Car horns).

## Possible Challenges:
1. Complex State Management
   - Balancing the player's three stats (Stamina/Mood/Time) alongside the "Hold-to-Interact" logic requires a sophisticated Finite State Machine (FSM). Handling the transition between Running, Sliding[...]
2. UI/UX in Canvas Environment
   - Since p5.js lacks native UI components, creating a responsive HUD (Heads-up Display) for stats and floating interaction bars (e.g., "Buying... 50%") requires writing a custom UI Manager class fro[...]

# Game 7: Plants vs. Zombies
## Game Type: Tower Defense / Strategy / Casual Puzzle Game
## Game Prototype: Plants vs. Zombies
## Game Description:
Grid-based lane defense where players place plants to repel zombies. Core loop: collect sunlight, place plants, repel zombies, adapt strategy, survive waves.

**Added Ideas - Icefield Mode:**
- Polar Day/Night Cycle with different resource and temperature rules
- Polar Day: frequent sunlight, 20% increased production
- Polar Night: scarce sunlight, frozen roads increase zombie speed, random snow falls (slows zombies, energizes plants hit by snow)
- Aurora Event: Green aurora empowers plants, Pink aurora empowers zombies
- Blizzard Event: reduces visibility on random tiles
- New Plants: Frost Pine (produces Ice Crystal Sunlight, briefly freezes zombies), Glacier Prism Shooter (light beam peas with Polar Day refraction), Aurora Spike Vine (continuous pierce with Aurora M[...]
- New Zombies: Studded Sled Zombie (accelerates on ice), Aurora Beacon Carrier (disrupts lighting plants)

## Possible Challenges:
Possible Challenges
System Design Challenges：Multi-System Coupling and Exponential Design Complexity
Challenge： Day–night cycles, terrain states, visibility, plants, and zombies do not function independently; instead, they interact with and modify each other.

Examples: Polar Night → reduced visibility → reliance on lighting plants Lighting plants → countered by aurora-based zombies Frozen terrain → destroyed by heavy stomping zombies

Risks： Difficult to predict whether all mechanic combinations are solvable High risk of “unsolvable levels” or a single dominant optimal strategy Mitigation Strategies Use an Interaction Matrix [...]

Implementation Challenges：Complex State Systems and Code Architecture
Challenge： A single unit may simultaneously be affected by: Day/Night state Freeze/Melt state Visibility modifiers Buffs and debuffs

Risks： State conflicts and unclear priority handling Bugs that are difficult to reproduce and debug

Mitigation Strategies： Adopt a state-driven architecture (e.g., State Machines or ECS) Make all states visualized and debuggable Define clear state priorities (e.g., Terrain > Time > Unit State)

- **Lemmings**: Indirect player control, problem-solving through positioning rather than direct action, and failure as part of learning.
## Core Gameplay
- **Indirect Player Control:** The player does not control the main attacking character. Instead, the player controls a supporting monster entity whose goal is to protect a hero NPC from incoming thre[...]
- **Periodic Skill-Based Interaction:** Each level assigns the player a different monster, each with a unique skill that activates automatically on a fixed cycle (e.g. every few seconds). Player agenc[...]
- **AI-Driven Environment:** The hero NPC autonomously moves and attacks enemies using a simple AI system. Other enemy entities actively target the hero. The player must use their monster’s skill ef[...]
- **Clear Win/Lose Conditions:**
  - Win: The hero survives long enough to eliminate all enemies in the level.
  - Lose: The hero’s health reaches zero.
## **Added Ideas:**
- **Indirect-Control Strategy Loop**: encourages planning, prediction, and spatial reasoning
- **Character-as-Mechanic Design:** each monster is a living game mechanic

# Game 11: Tower at the End
## Game Type: 2D Cooperative Puzzle Adventure, Mechanic-driven Level Progression
## Game Prototype
- Fireboy and Watergirl: Mandatory two-player cooperation, Asymmetric character abilities, and Precision-based environmental puzzles.
- FEZ: Mechanic-based world perception changes, Puzzle design driven by rule shifts rather than enemies.
## Core Gameplay
- **Exploration & Puzzle Solving**: Players explore compact but dense levels filled with interactive elements such as switches, platforms, and environmental hazards.
- **Asymmetric Cooperation**: Develop relationships with townsfolk, attend festivals, and explore character-driven storylines.
- **Exploration and Adventure**: Each character has unique interaction constraints (similar to Fireboy & Watergirl). Some paths or objects can only be accessed by one player, requiring constant teamwo[...]
- **Mechanic-Based Level Design**: each level introduces one core rule change, such as:
  - Gravity inversion zones
  - Object visibility toggled by position
  - Platforms that exist only for one player
  - Temporal switches that affect the other character
  - Mechanics are cumulative but controlled to avoid overwhelming players.

## **Added Ideas:**
- Rule-Switching Tower Structure: each level is a self-contained rule experiment
- Emotional Environmental Storytelling: world tells its story through ruins, lighting, sound, and silence
