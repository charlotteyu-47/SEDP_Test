### Game description 

- Craft & Life is an open-world sandbox life simulation game that blends the creative freedom of voxel-based building with the warmth and structure of a farming and social simulation.

- Players begin a new life in this game, a procedurally generated 3D world where every block can be shaped and transformed. Players are free to build their own home, cultivate farmland, explore caves, and interact with villagers who have unique personalities and daily routines.

- The game encourages players to balance creativity, productivity, and relationships. Seasonal changes affect crops, events, and NPC behavior, while progression systems unlock new tools, buildings, and narrative content. With a calm pace and cozy atmosphere, the game focuses on long-term development and emotional connection.
