### Game description 

- Craft & Life is an open-world sandbox life simulation game that blends the creative freedom of voxel-based building with the warmth and structure of a farming and social simulation.

- Players begin a new life in this game, a procedurally generated 3D world where every block can be shaped and transformed. Players are free to build their own home, cultivate farmland, explore caves, and interact with villagers who have unique personalities and daily routines.

- The game encourages players to balance creativity, productivity, and relationships. Seasonal changes affect crops, events, and NPC behavior, while progression systems unlock new tools, buildings and content like real life. With a calm pace and cozy atmosphere, the game focuses on long-term development and emotional connection.

### Added Idea Points 
- World Memory System 

  The game world remembers significant player actions over time. Locations gain historical meaning, environments change permanently, and NPCs react to past events, creating a persistent and evolving world shaped by player decisions.

- Behavior-Based Player Identity

  Instead of choosing a predefined role or class, the player’s identity is formed dynamically through gameplay behavior. NPC attitudes, dialogue, and story outcomes adapt based on how the player lives, builds, and interacts with the world.
  
### Possible Challenges
- Accidentally causing damage to the environment may affect subsequent development, and an archive function can be established to address this issue.

- A behavior-based identity system may lead to unexpected interpretations of player intent, potentially reducing players’ sense of control over their in-game identity.

- Persistent world memory and evolving environments increase technical complexity and may impact performance, especially in large, heavily modified worlds.
