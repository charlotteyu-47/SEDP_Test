## game 1: Flappy Bird
**Genre:** Arcade<br>
**Core Mechanics:** Players control a bird that moves vertically along the screen's axis, navigating through gaps between trees that scroll horizontally.<br>

**Added Idea Points：**  
Unlike the linear, one-hit-death mechanic of the original Flappy Bird, our game introduces 360-degree freedom. The player controls a bird that can move on both X and Y axes with a sophisticated acceleration system (dash mechanics). Instead of an infinite loop, the game features structured levels where the camera follows the player through vertical shafts and horizontal tunnels (Metroidvania-style traversal). Furthermore, we are replacing the "instant death" state with a health and resilience system: collisions deplete HP but allow for recovery frames, shifting the focus from frustration to precision mastery.

**Possible Challenges** 
1. The Camera System and Coordinate Transformation
2. Modularity in Scoring and Level Evaluation


## game 2: Tableturf Battle (from Splatoon 3)
**Genre:** turn-based strategy / Puzzle / Deck-building<br>
**Core Mechanics:** On a grid map, both sides compete to fill areas with colour by placing blocks of different shapes (similar to Tetris). <br>
Each block must connect to existing areas of their own colour, with the player controlling the largest contiguous territory at the end being declared the winner.

**Possible Challenges**
1. Intelligent AI Opponent
2. The game’s decision rules may be quite complex, including boundary conditions, which may require the use of extensive graph algorithms.



## game 3: Super Mario Bros
**Genre:** 2D Platformer<br>
**Core Mechanics:** Players leap between platforms, collect items, stomp on enemies, and reach the finish line.<br>
